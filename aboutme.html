    <h2>Dusan Vasica</h2>
    <h2>Duka Bazuka</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone, my name is Dusan and I am 24 years old freshman from Serbia.
         I would love to pursue career in IT field and that's why my degree is Software Engineering.
            I am still pretty new in this major so everything is kinda new for me. </p>
    <p>I have big family, five sisters and one brother and I am the third oldest. I love spending time
        with them. In my free time, I also love playing sports like basketball and soccer, listening music and hanging 
        friends. I am passionate about travelling and the gospel. </p>
    <p>I served my mission in Ohio and Michigan and that was life changing experience for me. One of my favorite scriptures is in the
        Book of Mormon in Alma 34:31 where Amulek promises: "Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any longer;
         for behold, now is the time and the day of your salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts,
        immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you. </p>
