    <p>Right around my 20th birthday, as I was preparing to go on a mission for my church, my sister invited me to come 
        and visit her in Taiwan. At the time, she and her husband lived in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan and I was thrilled
        to go there. My expectations were big but it is little to say that my experience in Taiwan exceeded all of my
        expectations. It was by far my favorite vacation and I will always cherish that memory.
        For years before this trip to Taiwan, I was used to spending a lot of time organizing trips, finding the cheapest tickets,
         and affordable accommodation but this was a different experience. All I had to do was just pack my bags and get to the
          airport, from the moment I landed in Taipei, I had nothing to worry about, my sister took care of everything. 
        My first impression of Taiwan was extreme humidity. It was almost hard to breathe but I got used to it. Besides enormous
         humidity, the weather was really hot but it was raining all the time. Taipei was a huge city, I spent two weeks there
          but I feel like I only got to see the smallest part of it. My sister and brother-in-law were the best hosts ever!
           They would take me to all kinds of places, restaurants, and trips. They had two scooters so that made it very
            convenient to get around the city. 
        Since I traveled most of Western Europe before that, I was kind of tired of architecture and crowded places, I wanted
         to experience some beautiful nature. Taiwan was just a perfect mixture of urban cities with modern as well as ancient
          architecture and magnificent nature, mountains, forests, and the Pacific ocean. It was a full package. One of the
           best things about Taiwan is definitely the people who live there, they are some of the kindest and most respectful
            people I ever met.
        The landmark of Taipei is a building called 101. The name of the building represents the number of floors and it is one 
        of the highest buildings in the world. This building was amazing, but my favorite thing about Taipei was these night
         markets. It was pretty much a bunch of street vendors selling all kinds of things in these small streets which would
          be crowded at night. I wish I had the capacity to eat much more of the street food these vendors were selling. Some
           of the most delicious and unusual food I have ever tried.
        Out of all the cities, I have ever visited, there are only a few that I would like to actually live in someday and Taipei
         is definitely one of those. After all, Taiwan was 10 out of 10. Unforgettable experience!
